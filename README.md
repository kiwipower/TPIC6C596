# TPIC6C596
Electric Imp compatible driver for the TPIC6C596 - used in the SparkFun Large Digit Driver

Based on the code and examples found at: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/large-digit-driver-hookup-guide?_ga=2.55402536.200087887.1528884570-211908983.1528884570

We have simply converted the example code into Squirrel, note that you will have to use a level shifter from 3.3V to 5V for this driver.

We have used this Driver to create a fun Display Board in our office. We hope you will find this code useful.
